## AI Governance Challenge

70% of Fortune 1000 companies lack structured AI governance and risk management. This leads to:

*   **AI Risk Exposure:** 47% increase in AI-related incidents affecting shareholder value.
*   **Regulatory Pressure:** Growing demands from EU AI Act, SEC disclosure requirements, and global regulations.

## Key Deliverables

*   **AI Risk Management Framework:** Develop and implement robust frameworks for identifying, assessing, and mitigating AI-specific risks, including model vulnerabilities, data privacy, and ethical concerns.
*   **Secure AI Development Lifecycle Integration:** Integrate security best practices throughout your AI development pipeline, from data ingestion and model training to deployment and monitoring.
*   **Board-Level AI Governance Strategy:** Establish comprehensive policies and procedures for responsible AI use and oversight, ensuring ethical considerations and regulatory compliance at the highest level.
*   **Regulatory Compliance & Advisory:** Navigate complex and evolving AI regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, SEC disclosure) with expert guidance to ensure adherence and minimize legal exposure.
*   **AI Maturity Model Assessment:** Evaluate your organization's current AI governance maturity and develop a roadmap for continuous improvement and excellence.
